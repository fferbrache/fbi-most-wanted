Pamela was 32 years-old, was 5’6” tall, weighed 120 pounds, and had shoulder-length brown hair. She was dressed in a black miniskirt and tan panty hose (no shoes or socks). She was last seen at the Union 76 Truck Stop, ten miles north along I65. She was sexually assaulted and died as a result of manual strangulation. She was 20 weeks pregnant at the time of her death.</p>\r\n<p>On March 1, 1992, the unidentified nude remains of a Hispanic/Latina (based on ancestral DNA) female were found off the westbound lane of Interstate 80 (I80), along the bottom of a slope, at the rest area known as “Bitter Creek”, 40 miles east of Rock Springs, WY. The victim was between 24 to 32 years old, was 5’8” tall, weighed130 pounds, and had collar-length brown hair. She had a long vertical scar on her abdomen, potentially a caesarean scar, and a red rose tattoo with what appears to be Chinese characters between the stem and the right leaf on her right breast. The cause of victim’s death could not be determined; however, due to the circumstances on how and where victim’s body was recovered this case is considered a homicide. The victim had evidence of trauma to her neck, face, and jaw as well as a potential puncture wound of the left nostril, which penetrated her spheroid bone. It could not be determined if this wound was by the offender or if it was the result of postmortem recovery. (Refer to figures 1 and 2 and National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) database, case report numbers UP8894.</p>\r\n<p>On April 13, 1992, the unidentified remains of a White female were found in a ditch along southbound Interstate 90 (I90), approximately five miles south of the WY and Montana (MT) state line, in Sheridan, WY. The victim was between 17 and 23 years old, was 5’5” tall, weighed 115 pounds, and had shoulder-length sun-bleached brown hair. The victim was fully clothed with the exception of her shoes and socks, which were never recovered. She wore size five Kayo of California medium blue jeans with a white plastic belt that had a gold-colored buckle; a size large Sauci brand blue and white checkered midriff blouse with pearl-colored ornamental buttons; a size 38C Chic brand light blue lacy bra, and size 5 to 6 Bill Blass brand dark blue and pink paisley print bikini panties. The victim was approximately 10 weeks pregnant at the time of her death. The cause of victim’s death could not be determined; however, due to the circumstances on how and where victim’s body was recovered this case is considered a homicide. (Refer to figures 3 and 4 and NamUs database, case report number UP9970.)</p>\r\n<p><br />The public is encouraged to provide any information that could assist in identifying the victims and the perpetrator responsible for their deaths.</p>",

Jane Doe is estimated to have been killed during the late 1970s to early 1980s by undetermined means. It is believed that Jane Doe was not originally from New Hampshire.  She was 2 to 4 years old at the time of her death, with slightly wavy brown hair, and approximately 3’3” to 3'9\" tall. She had a slight overbite that may have been noticeable.  An analysis of her bones suggests that she may have had anemia in life, but this cannot be confirmed. No clothing or personal items were recovered with her. DNA testing revealed Jane Doe's biological father is Terrence \"Terry\" Peder Rasmussen, who died in a California prison in 2010 after being convicted of the 2002 murder of his common-law wife.  Jane Doe's biological mother is unknown.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
