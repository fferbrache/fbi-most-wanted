          "details": "<p>On July 11, 2017, Margaret “Peggy” Thornton Lammers was found deceased inside her family’s vacation home on Stove Point in Deltaville, Virginia. A resident of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Lammers, who was a married mother of three adult children, was settling the estate of her parents in the Richmond and Middlesex County (Virginia) areas. Lammers departed Richmond for the Deltaville home on July 8, 2017. Her last known contact was the afternoon of July 10, 2017. After receiving a request for a welfare check, Middlesex County Sheriff’s Office arrived at the Deltaville home, where Lammers was found deceased, as a result of blunt force trauma. The FBI is asking for cooperation from the public regarding any information pertaining to Lammers’ death, people she was known to communicate with, or activity occurring near the residence.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

These Iranian hackers allegedly conspired to commit computer intrusions targeting American companies in the aerospace and satellite industries. They allegedly engaged in a coordinated campaign of social engineering that resulted in the theft of United States citizens’ identities, which they then used to steal critical information related to American aerospace and satellite technology and resources, including sensitive commercial information, intellectual property, and personal data. The men allegedly conducted this activity at the direction of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).  On September 15, 2020, a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria, Virginia, indicted Bayati on charges of Conspiracy to Commit Computer Intrusions and Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, and a federal arrest warrant was issued.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
