The victim was lost and had stopped on the highway shoulder to update her GPS. The offender approached her driver’s side window and asked if she was okay. He then ordered her out of the vehicle and displayed a handgun, possibly a small compact, black, semi-automatic. The suspect ordered the victim to the backseat of his vehicle, described as a late model Jeep Cherokee, or similar, gray or blue in color with cloth fabric. The victim was sexually assaulted in the backseat of the suspect’s vehicle. After the assault, the victim was ordered out of the car and left at the side of the road. The suspect was last seen making a U-turn and driving back towards Boulder.</p>\r\n<p>The victim did not recall seeing the suspect’s vehicle on the shoulder when she first stopped and did not see the suspect’s vehicle pull up behind her. The description of the suspect is vague, and it is believed he was a white male, approximately 5’11” in height.</p>\r\n<p>After further interviews with the victim, she was able to provide additional details about the offender: a white male with longer; bondish arm hair. He had rough hands similar to a person who works with his hands. She described a tattoo on his upper left arm, possibly green in color, circle shape. She was only able to see the lower portion of the tattoo, due to a short-sleeve shirt covering the rest of the tattoo.</p>",

          "details": "<p>On September 12, 1980, a 32-year-old male and his 22-year-old female companion traveled from their home state of Missouri to Iowa for a weekend getaway. They checked into the Amana Holiday Inn (along Interstate 80, just outside of Williamsburg) that evening and were found deceased the following afternoon by the motel maid. The victims had been stabbed to death, possibly with an axe or hatchet that had a 3 ½ inch blade. The male victim had seven stab wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat (including possible defensive wounds to his hands). The female victim had twelve stab wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat. There were no signs of forced entry into the motel room and no obvious signs of sexual assault. The victims were in bed, face-down, partly under the covers. The male victim was wearing only his underwear and the female victim was fully clothed. The victims’ personal belongings were scattered and approximately $200 was taken. Small pieces of a bar of bath soap were on the floor next to the bed. The word \"this\" was printed on the bathroom door, possibly using the bar of soap, and toothpaste was squeezed into the bathtub. Investigators have identified two cases with similarities to the instant case: the homicide of a 25-year-old male in Galesburg, Illinois, on June 24,1980 and the homicide of a 23-year-old male in Meridian, Mississippi on October 26, 1970. Like the instant case, the Galesburg and Meridian victims were away from home and staying in a motel room just off a busy Interstate. Additionally, in all three cases, toothpaste was found in an unusual location at the crime scene, the weapon used is believed to be a machete or sort of axe/hatchet, and money was taken. </p>\r\n<p>If you have information relevant to this investigation, or know of other cases that resemble the details of this homicide (e.g., victim(s) was killed in a motel room near a busy interstate; weapon used was an axe, hatchet, or machete; toothpaste or soap was found in an unusual location at the crime scene; writing or drawings were left at the crime scene), please contact the agency below.  </p>\r\n<p>&lt;p&gt;To provide or request additional information, please contact: Captain Todd Sauerbrei, Iowa County Sheriff’s Office, Iowa, (319) 642-7307, TSauerbrei@iowacosheriff.org - - FBI ViCAP, (800) 634-4097, vicap@fbi.gov </p>",
