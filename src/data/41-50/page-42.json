The proceeds of these credit card sales were allegedly deposited into bank accounts controlled by the defendant and others around the world, and were then transferred to bank accounts located in Europe. When customers complained that their purchases were actually fraudulent software, call center representatives were allegedly instructed to lie or provide refunds in order to prevent fraud reports to law enforcement or credit companies.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2010, Sundin was indicted in Chicago, Illinois, by a federal grand jury for the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois.

Shortly thereafter, while being interviewed by the Atlanta Police, Pasha was told that he was being charged with murder. Upon hearing this news, Pasha excused himself to use the restroom and was not seen again.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In late 2000, Pasha was arrested in Brooklyn, New York, and was returned to the state of Georgia. He was then diagnosed with medical problems and the charges against him were dismissed. In October of 2003, information was received that Pasha's medical condition had been misdiagnosed, and the District Attorney's Office decided to reindict him for murder, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. On January 14, 2004, a federal arrest warrant was issued in the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia, charging Pasha with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>",
