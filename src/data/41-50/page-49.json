On June 3, 1999, a state arrest warrant was issued by the District Court of Marshall County, Alabama, after Martinez was charged with murder. He was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest. Martinez is believed to have fled from Albertville in a vehicle which was later found abandoned near Interstate 59 and Rainsville, Alabama.
