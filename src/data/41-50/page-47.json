Germenis established an investment management and advisory business named Oracle Evolution LLC, which was based in Great Neck, New York. He created various hedge funds and expanded his business by attracting new investors through networking groups and personal referrals. Germenis eventually lost substantial sums of money due to poor investment choices, gambling, and the use of his clients' money to fund a lavish lifestyle. He then allegedly sent his clients falsified financial statements showing excellent investment returns, which led to more investment money from his victims.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The fraud collapsed when one of his largest investors sought to withdraw money from one of the hedge funds. The majority of those doing business with Germenis were middle-class people, and some were senior citizens who invested and lost their entire life savings. Together, more than twenty-five victims lost over eight million dollars.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Germenis disappeared in October of 2006. After telling his family that he was going to a baseball game, Germenis drove to JFK Airport in New York and boarded a flight to Athens, Greece. He has not been seen or heard from since.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On September 27, 2007, Germenis was charged with fraud by wire and a federal arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn, New York.</p>",

          "caution": "<p>Luis Ferreira, a convicted felon, is wanted for failing to surrender to serve a sentence in Florida for conspiracy to commit witness tampering in connection with his involvement in a high-yield investment scam to defraud individual investors.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>From mid-2008 through 2010, Ferreira was one of the principal owners of three investment firms that operated out of Deerfield Beach, Florida and solicited investments in precious metals. However, the investors were unable to liquidate accounts and company employees conducted unauthorized transactions on their behalf. Throughout that time, Ferreira was on supervised release in connection with a prior federal sentence and concealed his involvement in these firms from authorities.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On November 30, 2010, Ferreira was indicted for obstruction of justice, making false statements and conspiracy to obstruct justice, and he was arrested on December 7, 2010.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>In January 2011, Ferreira pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit witness tampering. On April 18, 2011, Ferreira was sentenced to 33 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Ferreira was released after sentencing and was scheduled to appear in prison no later than August 29, 2011. Ferreira was given electronic monitoring with curfew, however, on or about May 19, 2011, Ferreira did not report home for curfew and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest the next day.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>On August 29, 2011, Ferreira failed to report to prison to begin serving his sentence. Ferreira was indicted again on September 1, 2011 by a Federal Grand Jury for the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida for failure to surrender and contempt of court, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>",
