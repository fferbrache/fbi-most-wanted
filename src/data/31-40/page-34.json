          "caution": "<p>The Pittsburgh Office of the FBI, the Pennsylvania State Police, and the South Strabane Police are working to find the killer of a Washington, Pennsylvania, man who was shot and killed on Father’s Day, June 16, 2013, as he tried to stop a bank robber at the Strabane Square Shopping Center. The suspect entered the Giant Eagle supermarket around 2:20 p.m. and approached the Citizens Bank located inside the store. He jumped over the teller counter, demanded money, showed a gun, and left with a bag of money. The robber parked away from the store entrance, near the pharmacy drive-through area, apparently to be close to an exit from the parking lot. Police said he drove a “small-to-mid-sized” white four-door sedan south on Route 19 after leaving the shopping center and was last spotted just north of the interchange with I-70.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Vincent Kelley, 46, was killed in the shooting when he tried to stop the robber. Mr. Kelley had been grocery shopping with a friend when he witnessed the robbery. He chased the robber into the parking lot and struggled with him inside of the robber’s car. He was killed after being shot several times during the struggle.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>South Strabane Police said a red dye pack placed in the money bag exploded inside of the getaway car, creating a cloud of smoke. Authorities are asking any motorists who may have seen a car fitting the description, driving erratically, or filled with red smoke on Route 19 or Interstates 70 or 79 to notify law enforcement officials. In addition to creating red smoke, the dye pack, upon explosion, would have caused burns and other irritation to the suspect or anyone in the car with him and stains on the hands of anyone who handled the money. Anyone who knows someone with burns or red stains on their hands, or any auto shop that may be asked to clean a car with red stains on the interior, should report this to law enforcement. Police would also like anyone who took cell phone photos or video of the incident inside the Giant Eagle or outside in the parking lot to provide it to police.</p>",
