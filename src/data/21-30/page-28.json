Investigation has revealed that Mr. Holder arrived at the Dollar General Store in the early morning hours of October 14, 2016, parked his vehicle, and entered the store through the front entrance. While inside the store, Mr. Holder gathered the overnight cash deposits and placed them inside of a grey and black soft-sided cooler. Mr. Holder exited the business roughly 15 minutes later, and prepared to depart the premises in his vehicle; at which time an unknown subject is observed, on-camera in the parking lot, and fires multiple rounds at the victim. The unknown subject initially flees, then returns and opens the door to the victim’s vehicle.
