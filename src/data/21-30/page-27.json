Shortly after the plane took off, Montfort allegedly instructed a passenger to take a note to a flight attendant. When the passenger read the note, Montfort allegedly announced that he had a bomb and wanted to go to Cuba. Those on board the aircraft observed Montfort holding a small, plastic box with possibly a battery taped to its side and a wire or string that had a wire loop on the end through which he had placed his finger. Montfort's demands were relayed to the Captain of the plane, who then diverted his route and flew the plane to Havana, Cuba.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Montfort in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, on June 28, 1984, after he was charged with aircraft piracy.</p>",

Paramedics found the baby unresponsive and after transporting the baby to a local hospital, it was determined that the baby needed immediate definitive care and was airlifted to a children’s hospital in Aurora, Colorado, where the baby later died as a result of his injuries. It was later determined the infant suffered significant, severe abuse resulting in his death. Soon thereafter, Rivera-Meister fled Grand Island, Nebraska, and he is believed to have fled the United States for Guatemala.</p>\r\n<p>On January 24, 2017, a state arrest warrant was issued in the County Court of Hall County, Nebraska, charging Ryan D.
